    "final" keyword is very important in Java.

       1) "final" keyword can be used for variables
        public final int age =12;
        If you make a variable final you cannot change its value

        "final" variables must be initialized.
        public int age;
        public final int age; Error

        2) "final" keyword can be used for methods.
        "final" method body cannot be updated.

        3) "final" keyword can be used for classes.
        "final" keyword cannot be used for child classes.

        "final" keyword and "abstract ot extends" cannot be in same here.

        Note: "abstract classes" have something to do for child classes, if there is no child class having to do list is not sensible.
            "final classes" cannot have child classes there for java does not allow to make an abstract class final.

            "final" method body will be under protection by Java, because it should not be updated.
            But abstract methods do not have body, Java will look for the body to protect, when it could not find, it will complain.
